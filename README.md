Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Twitter Sentiment Analysis is a Machine Learning-based web application that classifies tweets as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on their textual content. It helps to understand public opinion on any topic in real-time by analyzing the emotional tone of tweets.

📌 Features
🔍 Real-time sentiment analysis of tweets

🧠 Machine learning models trained on labeled tweet datasets

📊 Visual representation of sentiment results (Pie charts, Word clouds, etc.)

🌐 Interactive web interface built with Flask

📤 Upload your own tweet data for analysis

💬 Clean UI for entering custom tweets

⚙️ How it Works
Data Preprocessing:
Tweets are cleaned (removal of links, mentions, hashtags, etc.), tokenized, and vectorized.

Sentiment Classification:
The ML model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM) predicts sentiment polarity.

Frontend Interaction:
Flask handles routing and rendering. Users can enter custom tweets or upload data files.
